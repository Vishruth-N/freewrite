## what is this?

freewriting is a technique from 1973 where you write continuously for a set time without stopping, editing, or caring about grammar. pure stream of consciousness.

this is not a journaling app or a note-taking app. if you use it for that, you'll open it twice and forget it exists.

this is a tool purely for freewriting — for unclogging your mental drain.

## how it works

1. think of something that's been bouncing around your head (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. click fullscreen
3. start the timer
4. write. no backspaces. don't stop.
5. reflect on your session by speaking your heart out with spill (click on the 'reflect' button)

when the timer ends, it fades back in. you're done.

## the rules (non-negotiable)

- no backspaces — truly enforce this by using the strict mode (padlock on the utility bar)
- no spell-checks
- brief 5-10 second pauses are fine, but keep your fingers moving
- let your mind wander
- no judgment

it's like your brain is gpt and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you'll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

## getting started

if you wanna make an addition + pr, or just wanna remix the app for yourself go for it.

- clone repo
- open in xcode
- click build
- done -- you're up and running

### voice ai assistant (reflect feature)

the reflect feature uses a python-based voice service. see [`voice_service/README.md`](voice_service/README.md) for setup instructions.

make changes on a pr and i'll run on my end and then build a new version :).
