# Hi, this is spill

a simple, open-source mac app to spill it out.

download latest version [here](https://www.tryspill.com/)

## what is this?

freewriting is this thing from 1973 where you just write. nonstop. for however long you set the timer. don't stop to fix typos, don't worry if it makes sense, don't even think about whether it's good. just let your brain dump everything onto the page.

this isn't your productivity app. it's not where you organize your life or take meeting notes. if you try to make it do that stuff, you'll use it twice, maybe three times, then it'll sit there collecting digital dust with all your other "life-changing" apps.

this is for one thing only — getting the mental sludge out of your head.

you know that feeling when your thoughts are all tangled up and you can't think straight? when your brain feels like a browser with 47 tabs open? that's what this fixes. you sit down, you write whatever garbage is floating around up there, and suddenly there's space to think again.

## how it works

1. think of something that's been bouncing around your head (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. click fullscreen
3. start the timer
4. write. no backspaces. don't stop.
5. reflect on your session by speaking your heart out with spill (click on the 'reflect' button)

when the timer ends, it fades back in. you're done.

## the rules (non-negotiable)

- no backspaces — truly enforce this by using the strict mode (padlock on the utility bar)
- no spell-checks
- brief 5-10 second pauses are fine, but keep your fingers moving
- let your mind wander
- no judgment

it's like your brain is gpt and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you'll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

## getting started

if you wanna make an addition + pr, or just wanna remix the app for yourself go for it.

- clone repo
- open in xcode
- click build
- done -- you're up and running

### voice ai assistant (reflect feature)

the reflect feature uses a python-based voice service. see [`voice_service/README.md`](voice_service/README.md) for setup instructions.

make changes on a pr and i'll run on my end and then build a new version :).
